# Introduction

So here's that "Hello Again World" post I promised.

# A personal note

One day when I was eight, for a variety of embarrassing reasons, I was taken aside at school and led to a small room with a study carrel next to a wall of metal bookshelves. On one of the shelves, pointed out to me as my study topic for the day, was an array of books that looked like an old weird encyclopedia. They turned out to be – more or less – the western canon circa 1952. The series was called literally _The Great Books of the Western World_, and, on understanding and belief, they started with A for Aristotle.

So I opened Aristotle and found what seemed to me to be the hidden code of the mind, the baseline assumptions underpinning every other damn thing told to me up to that point, before which nobody had ever explained that there could be rules for making sense, and after which every attempt at argument sounded like a cartoon version of ancient Greek philosophy with pieces missing.

Anyhow. I'm older now, and
<span class='copilot'>// I've read a lot more, and I've come to understand that Aristotle was a bit of a hack, and that the real code of life is in the [Principia Mathematica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica), and that the real code</span>

Oh god do I still have github copilot turned on, sorry, one second, sorry

Ugh it even added a wiki link. I feel dirty.

Okay. So. I'm older now and my Great Books story is a little silly. I realize that rationality is, at its best, a fun idea, and at its worst a do-what-you-please card, under whose aegis every atrocity has been committed, but still. I have a fondness for the simple cardboard cartoon forms of empiricism and proto-logical positivism that my newly-hatched brain built out of those chapters, and I still find them sometimes useful, and use them when I can.

My favorite of those fundamental ideas is still the first one, the one that's so basic Aristotle never addressed it directly but built the syllogism upon it, that being *synthesis*: that ideas can be derived from other ideas, and that you have to start somewhere.

So I thought I'd let's start at the beginning. This is about me, remember? 

# First principles

I grew up in puddles. Rain boots, soggy polyester insulation, wet jeans, gravel, and grey skies. Alder trees, mud, and fireweed. Here they are:
